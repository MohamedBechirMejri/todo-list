# todo-list

* t took me two weeks to finish this. it's much longer than expected. grandpa's death was part of it but the main reason is that I didn't plan the work properly, I only planned what I want the app to do not how to do it.
* the ui isn't that good as I have spent most of the time trying to make stuff work, I hope the next project will focus on the ui more.
* now I understand why companies require you to have experience. with every project I make, I learn alot of stuff.
* vscode is awesome.
